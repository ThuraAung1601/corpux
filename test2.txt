Corporate bonds offer a slightly higher yield compared to government bonds. 
However, they come with a moderate level of risk associated with the financial stability of the issuing company. 
In your case, as you are nearing retirement, you can consider investing in highly-rated corporate bonds to 
potentially earn a bit more than government bonds while maintaining a reasonable level of safety. Ensure you select bonds from reputable, financially stable companies to minimize credit risk.
